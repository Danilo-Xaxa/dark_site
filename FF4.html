                <h3>When the album is played simultaneously with the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz there are some correspondences between the film and the album.</h3>
                <h3>Some moments that indicate this are:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When Dorothy falls off the fence in which she is balancing, the song "On the run" begins indicating the moment of suspense. Afterwards, Dorothy's grandmother appears talking, and at this moment it is possible to hear a female voice in the background of the same song;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When Dorothy is on the farm and she looks up, airplane noise appears in the audio; When the witch is arriving by bicycle to kidnap Dororthy's dog, they start ringing the bells of the song "Time", analogous to the ringing of bicycle bells;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then the witch parks her bicycle in Dorothy's house pen and, while standing at the gate, Dorothy's grandfather slams the gate behind the witch. When the album and the film are exactly synchronized, at this knock on the gate the first note of the song "Time" is played;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the phrase "Home, home again" is sung from the "Breathe" rerun, Dorothy's dog enters his bedroom window after fleeing the witch;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The song "The great gig in the sky" is played at the moment of the film's suspense, where a tornado approaches the house. It is possible to perceive the three stages of music in sync with the suspense scenes, the dream / faint scenes and the calm scenes;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The sound of the cash register at the beginning of “Money” appears exactly when Dorothy first steps on the yellow brick road, which is also the moment when the film changes from black and white to color. Another reference is the appearance of the golden fairy;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The moment the witch of the West appears, the word "black" is played;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The scene in which Dorothy encounters the scarecrow (a character who claimed to have no brain) is accompanied by the song "Brain Damage" (brain damage), and when the lyrics start to play: "the lunatic is in my head…" (the lunatic is in my head), the scarecrow begins to dance frantically like a lunatic;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The heartbeat at the end of the album occurs when Dorothy tries to hear the tin man's heart; The moment the witch from the west launches a fireball at Dorothy and her companions, the song screams "run!" (run);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The moment Dorothy meets Oz, the song "Us and Them" enters, sounding Us like Oz right when Oz's 1st image appears;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Several phrases of the lyrics contained in the songs coincide with the same acts being performed by the actors at the same time;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The length of most songs coincides precisely with the length of the scenes in the film.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The band insists that these are pure coincidences. When this fact began to go public in 1997, it aroused enormous interest in this phenomenon. A small community has spread around several sites to further explore this idea. Whether the matches are true or imagined, some fans of the album like to see "Dark side of the rainbow", as this combination is often called. Synchronization is achieved by pausing (preferably the CD version) even at the beginning and stopping the pause when the MGM lion roars a third time. The MGM presentation (that of the lion) is considered to be a "pre-film". The CD (The dark side of the moon) must start between the fade-out (of the pre-movie) and the fade-in of the exact beginning of the film. Soon, the album and the film start exactly together.</h3>
                <h3>Pink Floyd members deny any relationship between the album and the film on a special MTV about the group in 2002. They say that this relationship could not be planned because they could not play the film in the studio, since at the time there were no video recorders yet.</h3>
